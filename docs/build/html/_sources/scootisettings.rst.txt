SCOOTI Settings
===============

Overview
--------
SCOOTI includes three different modules, including identifying metabolic regulators, flux predictions, and inference of metabolic objectives. This document will go through the required settings for users to choose the best options for their projects.

Identification of metabolic regulators
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash


Flux prediction
---------------

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash

   matlab -nosplash -noFigureWindows -r "multiObj_CBM($run, $DFA_kappa, $CFR_kappa, $CFR_rho, $COBRA_path,$GEM_path, $model_name, $obj_candidate_list_file, $input_obj_tb, $paraLen, $random_para, $init_objective, $genekoflag, $rxnkoflag, $FVAflag, $pfba, $medium_perturbation, $data_dir, $prefix_name, $medium, $late_stage, $early_stage, $simulation, $constraint, $save_root_path)"

Input settings
**************

*multiObj_CBM.m calls CFRinterface/DFAinterface to run CFR/DFA modeling and generate flux prediction based on transcriptomics/metabolomics data.*
*This code is capable of predicting fluxes with GEMs Recon1/Recon2.2/Recon3D, multi-objectives, gene knockouts, and with/without pFBA.*

  - *prefix_name* : string, name of experiment. it will be used for 
  - *medium* : string, name of sources of extracellular metabolites. options including DMEMF12 and KSOM
  - *late_stage* : string, name of late stage which also indicates the suffix of constraint files
  - *early_stage* : string, name of early stage which also indicates the suffix of constraint files
  - *simulation* : string, indicate which type of modeling method. options including CFR and DFA
  - *constraint* : bool, enable adding constraints or not
  - *save_root_path* : string, path to save the results of predicted fluxes
  - *CFR_model_path* : string. path to access the constrained CFR models. This is only for stacking/multiomics integration
  - *pairwise_CFR_model* : bool, match the name of the contrained CFR models or not
  - *extraWeight* : float, apply to scale the importance of contrained CFR models for stacking different constraints
  - *algorithm* : string, default value is iMAT but options including iMAT, MOOMIN, INIT (currently not working)
  - *data_series* : string, default value is an empty string and the input paths should be separated by ","
  - *prefix_series* : string, default value is an empty string and the input paths should be separated by ","
  - *medium_series* : string, default value is an empty string and the input paths should be separated by ","

**Output:**
  - *None*; however, the predicted fluxes will be saved


Objective Inference
-------------------

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
