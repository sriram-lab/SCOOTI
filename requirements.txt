## Usage
# Install with build isolation disabled so OApackage can see numpy and the pinned toolchain:
#   pip install --no-build-isolation -r requirements.txt
#
# Prereqs for OApackage build (choose one):
#   - Conda:   conda install -n scooti -c conda-forge "swig<4.1"
#   - Ubuntu:  sudo apt-get install swig=4.0.* (or build 4.0.x from source)
#
# Note: Cython<3 is included to match OApackage 2.6.9 build expectations.
